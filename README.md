## Bhavcopy-bse

### Instructions to run locally

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:dbads/Bhavcopy-bse.git` and `cd Bhavcopy-bse`
2. Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv path/to/venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the dependencies `pip install requirements.txt`
5. `cd src`
6. Run the server `python manage.py runserver`
7. go to `localhost:8000`
8. there won't be anything in the table initially, you see the data as soon as you type in the search input

Note: I have used [python app setup boilerplate](https://github.com/dbads/python-app-setup) which I created earlier for making setup faster, most of the app related stuff is in src folder
